Tick Tock
=========

A playground to play around with design of time keeping apps through React, Redux, SASS, CSS & various JS libraries.

Includes widgets for countdown timers, pomodoro styled workflow timers, time & date based countdown timers, and stopwatches.

Will eventually include desktop & app based progressive web apps, and probably react native mobile apps as well since iOS still doesn't allow for use of its notification API on progressive web apps.
