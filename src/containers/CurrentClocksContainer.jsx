 /** To be implemented...
 * The container for the collection of clocks that are currently in use.
 * This includes clocks that are currently paused (ie inactive).
 * When a clock gets removed, then they leave this container.
 * The container to all visible clock widet components.
 * Handles mapping of state objects of active clocks and --
 * -- mapping them to props of all the currently active clocks.
 * Then it renders them all in order.
 * Doesn't handle dispatching actions, each individual clock does.
